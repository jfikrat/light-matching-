# Light Matching

This project is a Next.js application that generates product images using Google Nano Banana, guided by prompts created with OpenAI's GPT‑5.

## API Overview

- `POST /api/prompts` – accepts a template name, product description and optional image to return a list of prompts from GPT‑5.
- `POST /api/images` – sends a prompt (and optional image) to Google Nano Banana to produce images.
- `POST /api/generate` – orchestrates the full flow: upload a product photo, choose a template and generation count (max 8). The endpoint asks GPT‑5 for that many prompts and returns images generated by Nano Banana for each.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set the following environment variables before running the app:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export GOOGLE_NANO_BANANA_API_KEY="your-google-key"
# optional: override the default endpoint if provided by Google
export GOOGLE_NANO_BANANA_ENDPOINT="https://your-endpoint"
```

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```
